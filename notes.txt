flake8 - used to check if your code conforms to the standard Python coding style
pytest - used for unit testing (checking a single function)

Code coverage - what is the percentage of your code covered by test? Library that is used in this area is pytest-cov.

In order to check for coding style violants in a file.py:
$ flake8 file.py --statistics 

Things to remember: two blank lines before a function being defined; indentation is 4 spaces (not a tab).

Before you run a test create a test file called test_file_to_be_tested.py. For instance, if you want to test calculator.py write your test in test_calculator.py.

$ pytest -v --cov


CircleCI

Create .ciricleci directory and a config.yml file inside.

jobs: if you have only one job it must be called build.

checkout: check the source code out to the working directory
